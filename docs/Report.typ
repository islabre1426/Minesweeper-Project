= Abstract
This project presents the design and implementation of a Minesweeper game clone developed as part of Algorithms and Data Structures course. Minesweeper is a well-known logic puzzle in which players uncover tiles on a grid while avoiding hidden mines, using numerical clues that indicate the number of adjacent mines. The primary objective of this project is to replicate the core mechanics, interface layout, and features of the original game, such as tile relevation, mine flagging, and a time-tracking system, while emphasizing the underlying algorithms and data structures required for efficient gameplay. Beyond recreating the game, the project aims to provide a practical context for exploring problem-solving strategies, algorithmic design, and data organization, as well as an engaging tool for relaxation outside academic work.
